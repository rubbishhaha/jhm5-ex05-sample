build 6 web applications:
1. landing page (cloudflare worker) of the other 5 application(#2-#5)
2. a client side Tication app using html,css and js only
3. a client side Tication app using localstorage and react 
4. a server side todo app using the same code of 3 but using cloudflare KV and server side API
5. a HKDSE analyser(based on table 3f) and using cloudflare D1
6. a "math rush" game app (a game to play with <- x/ with timelimit) with leaderboard

give me the design of each app and let me review first
